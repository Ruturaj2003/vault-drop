Think of changing the schema a bit , like this for targeting or rendering , it will get very hectic without the strcutre

since I have just made half component

rmeber somewhere named UserData type is mentioned change it

## Add like a info badge on files to get data like last used , time used etc

## encrypt the real file url

## Add Icon Bruh

## Note to self , dont use the npm script it seems to chache or somthing like that , stupid thing wasted so many hours, and keep using sonner toast

# TODO

1. Demo User Button
2. More Options funnctioanlity
3. Landing Page
