# Vault Drop

A small web app that lets users store two versions of a file ‚Äî a dummy and the real one. The real file is only shown if the viewer remains inactive for a short period.

## Project Inspiration

The idea came from imagining a ‚Äúspy scenario‚Äù where sensitive files are protected by a patience test. If an intruder or curious person quickly interacts with the file, they only see a harmless dummy version. However, if they wait without any action, the real file is revealed. This concept seemed like a fun way to mix simple inactivity detection with a bit of storytelling. I thought it would also fit well in puzzle games or escape rooms, where ‚ÄúPatience is the key‚Äù can be part of the challenge.

## How It Works

1.  Users log in using Clerk authentication.
2.  They can view their existing files or add new ones.
3.  Adding a file requires entering a pass key (create or enter an existing one).
4.  Each file consists of:

    - **Dummy file**: Shown first.
    - **Real file**: Revealed only if the viewer remains inactive for a set time. (now its 15 seconds)

5.  If any mouse, keyboard, or scroll activity is detected during that time, the dummy file remains visible.
